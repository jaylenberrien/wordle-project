Making a wordle game for my Per Scholas program

I am making my own version of the popular game wordle.

The game will give you 6 guesses to come up with a predetermined 5 letter word. After every guess you the letters and keyboard will update to show you how correct your guess was. The letters will turn green if the guessed letter is in the right spot and is actually in the word. They will show yellow if the guessed letter is in the word but not in the right spot. They will turn gray if the guessed letter isnt in the word at all.

You will get a prompt/animation if you win or if you lose.

The logic of the virtual keyboard and the "word checking" functionality was something that was suprisingly difficult, I hope to add more modes, ease of use changes, and more styling.

I used HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Js.

You can find the game here:

Next update: 

- Adding something that helps with duplicate letters
- Reworking the styling of the page to look more appealing
