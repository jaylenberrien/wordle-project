Making a wordle game for my Per Scholas program

I am making my own version of the popular game version.

The game will give you 6 guesses to come up with a predetermined 5 letter word. After every guess you the letters and keyboard will update to show you how correct your guess was. It will turn green if the guessed letter is in the right spot and is actually in the word. It will show yellow if the guessed letter is in the word but not in the right spot. It will turn gray if the guessed letter isnt in the word at all.

You will get a prompt if you win or if you lose.

The logic of the vitrual color changing was something that was suprisingly difficult, I hope to add more modes, quality of life changes, and more styling.

I used HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Js.

You can find the game here:
